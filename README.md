# fa20-lab
This repository contains my solutions to the CS61C-fa20 labs 

## lab
- [x] lab00 Intro and Set Up
- [x] lab01 Number Rep, C and CGDB
- [x] lab02 Advanced C
    * Exercise by implementing the bit manipulation functions
    * Implement a function to compute the next iteration of a linear feedback shift register (LFSR).
    * Familiarize with C structs and memory management.
- [x] lab03 RISCV Assembly
    * Practice running and debugging RISC-V assembly code.
    * Write RISC-V functions with the correct function calling procedure.
    * Get an idea of how to translate C code to RISC-V.
    * Get familiar with using the Venus simulator.
- [x] lab04 RISCV Functions, Pointers
    * Practice debugging RISC-V assembly code.
    * Write RISC-V functions that use pointers.
- [x] lab05 Logisim
    * Practice designing and debugging basic digital logic circuits in Logisim
    * Gain experience designing FSMs and implementing them as digital logic
- [x] lab06 Pipelining and CPU
    * Add a register to divide the multiplication and addition stages up to Complete the sub-circuit pipelined.
- [x] lab07 Caches
    * Analyze how memory access patterns determine cache hit rates
    * Analyze and discover which memory access patterns produce GOOD hit rates
    * Analyze hit rates for caches and be able to optimize code accesses to produce good hit rates
- [x] lab08 OS (context switch), I/O, DMA, Disks, Networking & Virtual Memory
    * Analyze TLB hit rate and Page Table hit rate and figure out what accesses optimize these values.
- [x] lab09 SIMD Instructions
    * Learn about and use various SIMD functions to perform data level parallelism
    * Write code to SIMD-ize certain functions
    * Learn about loop-unrolling and why it works
- [x] lab10 Thread Level Parallelism
    * Learn about basic OpenMP directives.
    * Learn about basic multi-processing programming.
- [ ] lab11 Spark/Dependability
